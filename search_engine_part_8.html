	<h1>Search Engine: Part 8</h1>

	In this lesson, we'll create a web ~front-end~ (the client-side part of our program) and ~back-end~ (the server-side part of our program) for our search engine. In my opinion, this is one of the most exciting steps in our project, since it finally allows us to showcase our project in a way that other people can see and use it. Here's a word of warning: this lesson will probably be pretty long because we haven't yet spent much time talking about web technologies. Understanding these technologies will require lots of explanations as we go.

	Any web application (of which our search engine is an example) will involve a conversation between two parties: the ~client~ (the party requesting information, such as an end user's web browser) and the ~server~ (the party giving out information, such as a remote computer that hosts a relevant program). We've already seen how to write Python functions and how to pass arguments into those functions. When writing web apps, you create your program on the expectation that you won't be the only person passing arguments into those functions, but in fact that users from all over the world could potentially want to pass in arguments and get results. The problem, then, is this: how do you get input from those users? It's simple enough for _you_ to give input; you're already sitting at the computer running the program. But if we want input from others, then we need to create a protocol for accepting input.

	~Web servers~ give us such protocols. Web servers _basically_ operate like this: they allow a computer to "listen" for incoming requests and to respond to those requests appropriately. In other words, when a client connects to a server and requests certain information, the server gets the requested information and passes it back to the client. If the client wishes to pass arguments to a function on the server, then the client passes in that information along with the request, and then the server takes the arguments, passes them to the relevant program, receives the results from the program, and passes them back to the user. There are all kinds of web servers out there, and you've probably heard of some of them: Apache, nginx, Microsoft-IIS, LiteSpeed, Tomcat, Lighttpd, and others.

	Web servers are designed to be highly configurable, meaning that server administrators are allowed to customize the way that the server responds to requests both in terms of security (blocking requests on certain ports or from certain locations or to certain system resources) and extensibility (connecting to other system resources, such as Python and Python programs). But for web servers to be able to talk with these other system resources, they usually need a "bridge" or "interface" by means of which they can talk to the resource, and which is usually provided by the system resource itself. After all, it'd be nearly impossible for a web server to know how to talk with _any_ system resource since resources are always being created. No, it's got to be the case that the resources themselves provide the bridge through which the server can talk to them. ~WSGI~ -- the Web Server Gateway Interface -- is a specification that outlines how someone can create a simple and universal bridge / interface between any web server and a resource. Python programmers have created many, many WSGI-compliant bridges that allow Python to talk with web servers, which means that we'll have plenty of options to choose from when it comes to building our web app.

	In addition to web servers, programmers often incorporate ~web frameworks~ into their workflow. Web frameworks handle most of the "heavy lifting" for the programmer and allow them to focus more on their program instead of on the process of customizing a web server and setting up the bridge between the program and the server. Again, Python programmers have been hard at work creating web frameworks that allow programmers like ourselves to focus more on our program than on configuring a web server and bridge. I looked at a lot of the current Python web frameworks, and the one that I liked the best was <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/" target="_blank">CherryPy</a>. CherryPy claims to be "a minimalist Python web framework," and I believe that it delivers on its claim. CherryPy will allow us to connect our program to the world wide web with a minimum of fuss.

	Similar to how we had to download, install, and import PickleDB, we need to do the same thing with CherryPy (since neither come preinstalled as part of Python). Run the following command from the command line (not from the Python shell).

	|
	pip install cherrypy
	|

	Once CherryPy is installed, we need to begin building our web back-end. Instead of adding stuff to our large `search.py` file, I think that it's time to branch out and create a new file in which we'll keep all of our web-server-related stuff: `web.py`. (Make sure to put it in the same directory as `search.py`.) What should we put in our `web.py` file? Well, let's take a quick gander at the example given on the CherryPy home page.

	<span class="python">
	|
	import cherrypy

	class HelloWorld(object):
		def index(self):
			return "Hello, world!"
		index.exposed = True

	cherrypy.quickstart(HelloWorld())
	|
	</span>

	Let's unpack this code. First, they import the CherryPy library. Then, they create a class called `HelloWorld(object)`. If you read <a href="http://phscs.github.io/classes.html" target="_blank">our lesson on Python classes</a>, then you'll recall that the stuff in parentheses (`(object)`) is the superclass of `HelloWorld`. In other words, the `HelloWorld` class will automatically inherit methods and attributes from the `object` class. Inside of the `HelloWorld` class, then, we see a single function definition: `index(self)`. You may recall that class functions are called _methods_, and that they always require that `self` be passed as their first argument. In the case of this example, this method only returns some text. Then, we're shown that the `index()` method actually has an attribute called `exposed`, which is set to `True`. This attribute determines whether the method is available to the public or not. (We'll discuss this particular attribute more in a moment.) Last, the `cherrypy.quickstart(HelloWorld())` call launches a simple web server using the new `HelloWorld` class. You should try this code out; it really works. Copy the code above into `web.py`, save the file, and then run the following from the command line.

	<span class="python">
	|
	python web.py
	|
	</span>

	If everything was properly installed, then the web server should start correctly, and you should be able to navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/</a> in your browser, at which point you'll be greeted by the text "Hello, world!"!

	You might've been wondering something just now. You might have wondered, "Why has the method been named `index()`? Could it have been given some other name?" Good question. The name `index()` is reserved as the "root" function for the website. In other words, if someone simply navigates to <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/</a>, without anything after it, then CherryPy calls for the `index()` function. But it's possible to create other functions, and then to call them by appending their names to <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/</a>. For instance:

	<span class="python">
	|
	class HelloWorld(object):
		def index(self):
			return "Hello, world!"
		index.exposed = True

		def foo(self):
			return "bar"
		foo.exposed = True
	|
	</span>

	If we navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/foo" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/foo</a> in the browser, we're greeted by "bar"! Yay! This is important for our search engine because we need to provide basically two pages for our users: a "home" page (i.e., the "root" or `index()` page) that shows a search form in which users can type and submit a query, and a "results" page (i.e., a page that shows the stuff returned from the `query()` function).

	And now I need to make another digression. I said a moment ago that I wanted to talk more about the `exposed` attribute for methods in CherryPy. This is actually really important. Exposing certain methods to the public (i.e., allowing the public to call those methods) can be both useful and dangerous. On the one hand, we want users to be able to call certain methods remotely (like our `query()` function). On the other hand, we _don't_ want users to be able to call other certain methods remotely (like our `add_to_index()` or `uprank_popularity()` functions -- or most of our other functions, for that matter). When we expose certain methods for public use, we're creating an ~API~, an Application Programming Interface. Many popular web apps and services expose APIs for programmers' use. These APIs allow programmers to create cool programs that use those apps and services.

	For example, Twitter exposes an API for public use. Of course, Twitter almost certainly has lots of functions that it _doesn't_ expose for public use because of security concerns, but the public API is still useful because programmers can use it to do all kinds of things. We could imagine writing a program that would plot the locations of tweets containing #justinbieber on a map of the world. In such a program, we'd have to use the Twitter API to query for tweets that contain that particular hashtag.

	Okay, with all of those things in mind, let's see if we can write new `web.py` in pseudo-code. I'm going to create two functions because there are basically two pages that users will need to access: a "home" page that shows the search form, and a "results" page that shows the results from the search. Therefore, we'll create a class called `SE` (short for "Search Engine") and give it two methods.

	<span class="python">
	|
	import cherrypy

	class SE(object):
		def index(self):
			return a search form
		index.exposed = True

		def q(self, search_string):
			return the results of query(search_string)
		q.exposed = True

	cherrypy.quickstart(SE())
	|
	</span>

	Good. One obvious problem, though, is that this program won't currently understand what we mean by `query(search_string)`. It doesn't have any connection with our search engine, so how _could_ it understand what we mean? To connect `web.py` to `search.py`, we simply have to import the latter.

	<span class="python">
	|
	import cherrypy
	import search # here's where we import our search engine!

	class SE(object):
		def index(self):
			return a search form # this is the only line of pseudo-code!
		index.exposed = True

		def q(self, search_string):
			return search.query(search_string) # notice the syntax here
		q.exposed = True

	cherrypy.quickstart(SE())
	|
	</span>

	Notice the syntax when I called the `query()` function; I actually called it with `search.query()`. If you're familiar with classes, you might be thinking that the "dot" notation indicates a method call to a class, and you might be confused about the fact that `search` isn't really a class -- and you're right. It's _not_ a class, but it _is_ a ~namespace~. Namespaces are mappings of names to objects. Namespaces are very similar to classes. In fact, when a class is read into the interpreter, a new namespace is created. Then, when you want to call methods from that namespace, you use the "dot" notation. So, although `search` is _not_ a class, it _is_ a namespace, and namespace method calls require use of "dot" notation. Since classes generate namespaces, this is also why class method calls require use of "dot" notation.

	Our next step, then is to figure out what to return as a search form in our `index()` method. The form that we'll return must be written in HTML. Here's a possible HTML form.

	|
	&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Search Engine&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;form action=&#39;q&#39; method=&#39;get&#39;&gt;
			&lt;input type=&#39;text&#39; name=&#39;search_string&#39;&gt;
			&lt;input type=&#39;submit&#39; value=&#39;Submit&#39;&gt;
		&lt;/form&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;
	|

	This page will be rendered by the browser to look like this (without the orange border, obviously):

	<div class="example">
		<h3>Search Engine</h3>
		<form action="javascript:null">
			<input type='text' name='search_string'>
			<input type='submit' value='Submit'>
		</form>
	</div>

	Let's examine the HTML code above. First, we open and close the entire document with `&lt;html&gt;` tags. In larger HTML documents, we'd also include a `&lt;head&gt;` section as an older sibling to the `&lt;body&gt;` section. The `&lt;h3&gt;` tag indicates a header of some size. Then we come to the form itself, which has two main attributes: `action` and `method`. The `action` is the function that gets called on the web server, and the `method` is basically the way that the protocol by which the function gets called. The GET method implies that you're only _getting_ information from the server. The most common other method is POST, which implies that you wish to _give_ information to the server in such a way that the server changes its internal state. While it is technically true that we are passing information to the server (our search string), we're also not asking the server to change its state. You'd want to use POST for times when you need the server to store information to a database, for example. There are other form methods, but, as I said, these two are the most common -- and really, we only need GET.

	The form also contains two `&lt;input&gt;` fields: a text box, and a "submit" button. The `name` attribute of the text box is critical; this name is the variable that gets passed into the function that's called when the form is submitted (and remember that it's the `q()` function that gets called).

	With all of these things in mind, let's update our `web.py` file.

	<span class="python">
	|
	import cherrypy
	import search

	search.crawl(&quot;index.html&quot;)

	form = &quot;&lt;html&gt; \
			&lt;body&gt; \
				&lt;h3&gt;Search Engine&lt;/h3&gt; \
				&lt;form action=&#39;q&#39; method=&#39;get&#39;&gt; \
					&lt;input type=&#39;text&#39; name=&#39;search_string&#39;&gt; \
					&lt;input type=&#39;submit&#39; value=&#39;Submit&#39;&gt; \
				&lt;/form&gt; \
			&lt;/body&gt; \
			&lt;/html&gt;&quot;

	class SE(object):
		def index(self):
			return form

		def q(self, search_string):
			urls = search.query(search_string)
			results = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot;
			if urls != [&quot;No results found.&quot;]:
				results += &quot;&lt;ul&gt;&quot;
				for url in urls:
					results += &quot;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;&quot;  + url[0] + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + url[0] + &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;
				results += &quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;
			else:
				results += &quot;No results found.&quot;
				results += &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;

			return results

		index.exposed = True
		q.exposed = True

	cherrypy.quickstart(SE())
	|
	</span>

	So the code above (in case you can't understand it by now) grabs the query results, and then (depending on the results) either wraps them up in an unordered list of links or else returns "No results found."

	Again, if you copy all of this into your `web.py` file and run it from the command line with `python web.py`, you'll be able to access the working search engine from <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/</a>.

	There's only one other quick feature that I'd like to add. You may have noticed near the top of `web.py` the call to `crawl("index.html")`. This crawl will be very quick because the `index.html` file lives on our file system, and there's only four very small pages to crawl. But suppose that we had called `crawl("http://www.wikipedia.org/")`, or something like that. In such a case, our crawler would take a _very_ long time to complete -- and our web server can't launch until it's done. This is because, as you probably recall, the Python interpreter runs things one line at a time. If one line takes a long time to execute, well too bad for us; we simply have to wait for it to finish. Or do we? In fact, the computer is capable of doing many things at once, as is obviously illustrated by the fact that we can run a virus scan while we play a game and type a document and listen to music. How does the computer do this? Well, you'll recall that our code itself is passive; it doesn't do anything until the computer executes it. When the computer does execute it, the execution is called a ~process~. All computers have a ~processor~, which is the actual "organ" inside of the computer that executes the code. Some computers even have multiple processors. In such a case, the computer is able to launch multiple simultaneous processes. But even if the computer only has one processor, then most operating systems are smart enough to be able to handle multiple "simultaneous" processes. (I put "simultaneous" in quotes because it's not quite true that they really occur at the same time; often, what happens is that the processor goes through the list of active processes and gives each of them a little bit of its attention until all they're all finished executing.) In addition to running multiple processes simultaneously, it's also possible for each process to have multiple simultaneous ~threads~ (paths) of execution. Each process is made up of threads. From a hierarchical standpoint, processes don't share memory spaces, whereas threads do because they are the children of processes.

	When we call for `python web.py`, we are launching a new Python process. Within this process, there is currently only one thread of execution. But what we'd like to do, presumably, is ask our `crawl()` function to operate in a separate thread. That way, our web server can go ahead and launch, and we don't have ot wait for the `crawl()` function to finish. Of course, this also means that people could potentially begin querying for results before the crawler has finished gathering all of its data, but this outcome is probably preferable to forcing users to wait to query until the crawler is finished doing its job.

	So how do we add this magical multi-threading support to our web app? We need to import the appropriate library, called `thread`. Then, we need to call it. Instead of this:

	<span class="python">
	|
	search.crawl("index.html")
	|
	</span>

	We now have:

	<span class="python">
	|
	import thread

	thread.start_new_thread(search.crawl, ("index.html",))
	|
	</span>

	The syntax for the new method call is `thread.start_new_thread(function, (arg, arg, arg, ...))`. The `function` is followed by a list of arguments. This list must be in the form of a ~tuple~, which is a special kind of immutable Python list. Arrays are always enclosed in square brackets, but tuples are always enclosed in parentheses. But there's one weird thing to remember about tuples: if they contain only one element, then that element must be followed by a comma. If you don't follow the single element by a comma, then Python will think that you're merely wrapping an expression in parentheses for the sake of clarity. That's why `"index.html"` is followed by a comma in the example above.

	Here's the finished product.

	<span class="python">
	|
	import cherrypy
	import search
	import thread

	thread.start_new_thread(search.crawl, (&quot;index.html&quot;,))

	form = &quot;&lt;html&gt; \
		&lt;body&gt; \
			&lt;h3&gt;Search Engine&lt;/h3&gt; \
			&lt;form action=&#39;q&#39; method=&#39;get&#39;&gt; \
				&lt;input type=&#39;text&#39; name=&#39;search_string&#39;&gt; \
				&lt;input type=&#39;submit&#39; value=&#39;Submit&#39;&gt; \
			&lt;/form&gt; \
		&lt;/body&gt; \
		&lt;/html&gt;&quot;

	class SE(object):
		def index(self):
			return form

		def q(self, search_string):
			urls = search.query(search_string)
			results = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot;
			if urls != [&quot;No results found.&quot;]:
				results += &quot;&lt;ul&gt;&quot;
				for url in urls:
					results += &quot;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;&quot;  + url[0] + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + url[0] + &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;
				results += &quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;
			else:
				results += &quot;No results found.&quot;
				results += &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;

			return results

		index.exposed = True
		q.exposed = True

	cherrypy.quickstart(SE())
	|
	</span>

	Well, this lesson has gone on for pretty long as it is, so I'll probably wrap it up here. Obviously, our product isn't very aesthetically pleasing yet, but those are just details. For now, we've created the core of our web app!
