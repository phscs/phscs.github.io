	<h1>10001st Prime (Complete Solution)</h1>

	In the previous lesson, we built a set of working functions that returned to us the 10001st prime number. Unfortunately, that process took several minutes, and I hinted at the fact that we could perhaps ~optimize~ the functions in such a way that they return quicker (but still accurate) results.

	Since we already talked about this, I'll just remind you of the optimization that we chose. As we were deciding whether or not a candidate was prime, we felt the need to check every single number between 2 and our candidate to see if such a number was one of our candidate's factors. It turns out that we needn't have checked every one of those numbers; we only need to check the numbers from 2 to the square root of our candidate in order to determine if the candidate has any factors.

	Here's our final solution:
	<span class="python">
	|
	def isPrime(n):
			for factor in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1): # here's the only line that we needed to change!
					if n % factor == 0:
							return False

			return True

	def nthPrime(n):
			primes = 0
			possiblePrime = 1

			while primes < n:
					possiblePrime += 1
					if isPrime(possiblePrime):
							primes +=1

			return possiblePrime

	nthPrime(10001)
	|
	</span>

	This optimization allows us to calculate the 10001st prime in _less than a second_, rather than in four or five minutes!
